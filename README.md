# Funnel-metadynamics
This repo is designed to give initial files to perform Funnel metadynamics as described in the paper Resolving the problem of trapped water in binding cavities: prediction of hostâ€“guest binding free energies in the SAMPL5 challenge by funnel metadynamics (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-016-9948-6)

This repo is mainly compatible with Plumed 1.3 (request: will be great if someone wants to make a Plumed 2.6 compatible version of this repo)
